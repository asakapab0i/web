	<p>Brian is a fiction writer and visual artist living in Brooklyn.  His assemblages are often situated in collaged wooden boxes, in which blocks of clear resin--containing preserved biological specimens, glass vials, antique texts, cloth, and other items--are mounted. These box constructions involve images and themes which also occur in his stories.  He is interested in the Wunderkammer or cabinet of curiosities as a genre with both plastic and literary possibilities.</p>

His stories have been nominated for the Pushcart Prize three times, and his collection <i>The Sleeping Sickness</i> was a finalist in the 2005 Iowa Short Fiction Awards. He has been awarded residencies at Blue Mountain Center in the Adirondacks and Hall Farm Center in Vermont.  He holds a Ph.D. in English & American Literature from New York University, with a dissertation on David Foster Wallace\'s <i>Infinite Jest</i>.
