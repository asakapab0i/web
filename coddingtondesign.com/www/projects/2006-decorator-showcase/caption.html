Showcase House 2006
San Francisco, CA

The carriage house suite was designed to accentuate air and light, as evidenced by the large windows and open beam ceiling.  By placing fine antiques and luxurious fabrics in this rustic environment, guests are treated to the same level of comfort and elegance established in the main house.   The suite features hand-scraped reclaimed pecan floors.  The bathroom is a combination of fresh modern elements and historic charm.   The clawfoot tub was given a sophisticated makeover by chroming the feet and painting subtle stripes along the outside.  The view of the garden is framed by a light-as-air window treatment and modern floral wallpaper in neutral tones.
