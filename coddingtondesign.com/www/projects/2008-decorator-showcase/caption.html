Showcase House 2008
San Francisco, CA

Abundant natural light and panoramic views of San Francisco and the bay set the tone for the light color palette and serene mood of this master bedroom suite. Her bathroom features  stunning bookmatched onyx and an indulgent chandelier.  Her closet is a pure fantasy of mid century fashion drawings hung on Lucite rods.
