Nob Hill Residence
San Francisco, CA

The entrepreneur owner of this quintessential San Francisco apartment wanted a home that would serve both as a welcoming retreat and a sophisticated space for entertaining. Coddington Design created a serene but glamorous space:  an understated palette of ivory and camel tones is a backdrop for luxurious silk velvet tiger club chairs, silk and linen striped drapes and a tufted velvet sofa. The Maison Jansen dining table, custom pieces and the use of mirror and parchment also inject an element of urbane, 1940s-era Parisian style.
