Pasadena Residence
Pasadena, CA

These rooms were designed for clients who often travel internationally and craved a restful retreat to come home to.  They love a particular hotel in Ireland that inspired the English style.  The interiors feature mostly English furniture with a few modern details like the spaced chrome nail head on the wing chairs and the satin nickel drapery hardware.
