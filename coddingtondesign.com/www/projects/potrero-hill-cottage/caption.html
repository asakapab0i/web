Potrero Hill Cottage
San Francisco, CA

This cottage has been Melanie’s labor of love and design lab for the past few years.  She wanted a beautiful jewel box that wouldn’t break the budget or compromise quality.    The result is a girly modern showcase of Swedish and French antiques, America mid-century and flea market finds paired with modern items and art.  The living room beaded wallpaper, the dining room Venetian horse chandelier and the custom velvet sofa and vintage moth lamp in the den are a few of her favorites in the home.
