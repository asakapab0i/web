Presidio Heights Residence
San Francisco, CA

This family room was designed to accommodate lots of young, active children.  Sharp corners and fragile finishes were judiciously avoided without sacrificing style.  The room features custom sofa, vellum bookshelves and a unique cerused oak and green lacquer secretary. The nursery features a sophisticated grey blue and blush pink color scheme, a floral border at the ceiling, and layers of sumptuous fabrics.
