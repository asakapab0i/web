<p>Jessica Grindstaff is a NYC-based artist who has had numerous <a href="/exhibitions/">gallery showings</a> in the NY area over the past ten years. She has also worked as an amateur entomologist, taught at an anarchist art school in Denmark, produced large-scale photo shoots, and most recently created a jewelry line of <a href="/prizes/">prize ribbons and medals</a>.</p>

<p>Previously known for making haunting and meticulously constructed <a href="/artwork/#boxes">music box dioramas</a> as well as wax and chalkboard <a href="/artworks/#paintings">paintings</a>, Jessica recently branched out into the position of designer on two prominent new works of art.</p>

Danielewski and was the art director and interior set designer for the much acclaimed marionette play, <i>The Fortune Teller</i> by Erik Sanko. In the spring of 2007, she was a contributing artist to Ulrike Quade's <i>The Wall</i> performed at MASS MoCA, which she will tour with this fall in the Netherlands.
