<p>Modern simplicity and old-world craftsmanship mark the highest quality of custom furniture for design + build company Naula Workshop. Since 2002, founder and creative director Angel Naula has brought together a group of artisans and designers to create a workshop that thrives on the idea that, at its inception, each piece is of its own unique design.</p>
<p>“My work involves very specific elements of the traditional furniture I grew up building in my family’s workshop – the singularity of each piece, the craft and the skill – and fusing it with elements of modern aesthetics – the art, the design, and the functionality,” says Naula.</p>
<p>Symmetrically drawing the senses together – how it looks and how it feels - begins with an attention to detail that few furniture manufacturers offer. It is this philosophy and the group that sustains it that defines Naula Workshop.</p>
