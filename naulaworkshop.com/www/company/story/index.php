<p>Born in Cuenca, Ecuador, Angel Naula has spent nearly his entire life designing and fabricating custom furniture, apprenticing in his familyâ€™s own workshop until the age of six and building his first piece of furniture when he was just 13. Upon immigrating to the United States, Angel carried on the integrity, mastery, and craftsmanship instilled by his father, his grandfather, and the generations of furniture makers before them.</p>
<p>In 2002, Angel opened Naula Workshop and has since collaborated with such acclaimed interior designers and architects as Robin Wilson, Jamie Drake, Kelly Behun, Philip Gorrivan, and Mark Zeff. He has completed high-profile residential projects for Robert Kennedy Jr., Lenny Kravitz, Hugh Jackman, Norah Jones, and Rupert Murdoch, as well as commerical projects for Mandarin Oriental NY, LaGuardia Airport, and various celebrated restaurants. His work has also been featured in such notable venues as Esquire SoHo, Pulse Contemporary Art, Maison de Luxe Beverly Hills, and the Hampton Designer Showhouse.</p>
