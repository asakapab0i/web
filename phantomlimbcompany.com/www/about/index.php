Erik composed and performed music for Ulrike Quade's The Wall and in 2007 Erik formed Phantom Limb with Jessica Grindstaff, under which all of their subsequent projects have been created. With Phantom Limb he scored and designed marionettes for Ping Chong’s “The Devil You Know” and designed marionettes for the Lemony Snicket production “The Composer is Dead” at The Berkeley Repertory Theater in Dec. 2010. For 2013-14, Erik will be collaborating with Phil Kline and Jim Jarmusch on an opera about Nikola Tesla. Erik is presently working on an adaptation of Peer Gynt, a marionette play with kites and a piece about the world’s oldest living tree.

	<p><img src="gia-wolff.jpg" alt="Gia Wolff" width="157" height="175" class="headshot"/><strong>Gia Wolff Collaborating Architectural Designer</strong>
	Gia Wolff is an architectural designer who has always been compelled by the workings of performance and its use of space and objects to convey narrative, form, and emotion.  She is interested in architecture that embodies a reciprocal relationship between the user and the built environment and questions the performative aspects of the discipline.  Her work isn't about rational functionalism, and static objects are just too removed from the sharpness of situations.  Instead, the work requires users to actively question how they relate both in time and scale.</p>
	<p>Wolff has worked at the architecture practices of Acconci Studio, Adjaye Associates, and LOT-EK.  She received a master's degree in Architecture from Harvard Graduate School of Design in 2008 and a Bachelor of Fine Arts from Parsons School of Design in 2001. Wolff is an Assistant Professor Adjunct of The Irwin S. Chanin School of Architecture at The Cooper Union where she teaches the first year architectural drawing class with Professor Michael Webb. She is also a Visiting Assistant Professor at Pratt Institute where she teaches undergraduate design studios. </p>
