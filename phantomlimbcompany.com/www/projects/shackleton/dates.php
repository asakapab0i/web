<i>The Shackleton Project</i> is a series of dynamic <i>tableau vivants</i> inspired by Sir Ernest Shackleton's 1914 Trans-Antarctic Expedition.  
Co-conceived by The Phantom Limb Company and The Kronos Quartet, this narrative installation-in-motion melds theatrical performance, puppetry, photography, and 
film with original contemporary music and an unconventional acoustic palette to create a stunning&mdash;and unprecedented&mdash;artistic and emotional journey.<br>
