I became really interested in different illnesses and learned about ones most children my age did not know about. I learned about illnesses like shingles, puerperal fever, bubonic plague, etc. When I went to the pediatrician when I was nine, I asked about puerperal fever. I knew how to take care of certain ailments like if you had a high fever; you had to take a lukewarm bath. When he retired, I wrote a book about illnesses and being a doctor. I wrote many stories about people and animals being ill.
