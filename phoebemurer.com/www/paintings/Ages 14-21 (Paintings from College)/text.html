I had some interesting drawing teachers. For media on paper we had this teacher named Wendell* who was like a drill sergeant. He would make us do a lot of art work for homework with different mediums and work our asses off. He was picky about how we did our homework. Then we would have a critique every week. If we did not work hard enough, he would make us redo the assignment. He also seemed to pick on the students who did not do as well. He put on a cold tough fa&ccedil;ade in public but softened up when there were not many students there. I made some really interesting art pieces which were amusing to my classmates and Wendell. Wendell once announced to the class he did not like my art work but it was good.  His class inspired me to do a series of collages of me at each age from age 13-21. Then I made a painting from each collage. That project lasted about two years. All the paintings were 18 x 24 inches. All the collages were mixed medium on paper.
