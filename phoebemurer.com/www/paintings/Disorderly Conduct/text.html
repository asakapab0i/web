Shirley* had a friend, Jennifer, who worked as an art therapist at the Psychiatric Hospital I spent time in before Arcadia. She had Jennifer do a presentation on mood disorders at Arcadia. When she and Shirley were preparing for the presentation, I asked her if she knew Mildred. She refused to tell me because of privacy issues. I told Jennifer I was an inpatient in her hospital once and asked her if she remembered me even though I did not remember her. She said no. Then she and I talked about what was going on with her hospital. She was giving me updates on what was going on with psychiatric hospitals in general.

After Jennifer did her presentation on mood disorders, she had us do one of her tasks she did with her patients in the psychiatric hospital to see how college students would do on it. I mentioned I was mentally ill with bipolar and OCD, so I was a Òmentally ill college student.Ó My approach to the task showed a lot of anxiety and chaos. I warned her about that. She seemed indifferent.
