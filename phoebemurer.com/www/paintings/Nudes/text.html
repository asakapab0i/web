Because I did my first semester part time, it took three semesters to do my freshmen year. The second semester, I took figure modeling and some print making classes. In those classes, you had to buy your own tools and pay a clay or ink fee. For the painting and drawing classes, you had to buy all your own materials which could cost a fortune. Fortunately, the art stores had discounts for art students and teachers. At Devereux Day school, the teachers provided the text books and we returned them at the end of the year. We got our work books for free though. Nothing was free at PAFA except food at art shows.
