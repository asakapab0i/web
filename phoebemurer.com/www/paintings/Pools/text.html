I had a grandiose idea of my future when I was nine and ten. I planned on making a living selling art and being a teacher. I also said I was going to live in a swanky camp I built myself with a huge saltwater wave pool and a fresh water pool. Both would have high diving boards and water slides. I would also have a manmade lake. I was going to have six children and have many animals. I was also going to have a pollution pond, which was a pond especially to dump all my waste in. I was afraid of dumping buckets of dirty water in the toilet because I feared stopping them up. I had a phobia of stopping up toilets. Anyway, my house and everything on my land would be built by me. I was going to make it into a camp for the summers that anybody could come to. I made several pictures of it.  I wanted to live in a place where there were no earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis, wars, tornadoes, volcanoes, and floods. The place had to have minimal crime. I did not want to live in the city because I could not own a pool.
