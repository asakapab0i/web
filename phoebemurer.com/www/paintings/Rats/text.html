In Psychology as a Natural Science, we all had pair up and work with a lab rat for a few weeks. We had to teach them things. We had to water deprive them while doing so. I hated water depriving my rat, but loved cuddling with him and teaching him things. I bonded with him. My last semester at Arcadia, I volunteered in the rat lab to feed the rats and clean the rat cages. I petted all of them. I bonded with several of them. I met several of the students that way and told them several rat stories. I also talked to the professors a lot about rats. I was known for being an artist and a rat lover. I went in the rat labs and did sketches of the rats. One of the professors had me do a sketch of a lab rat to put on a cover of a thesis book.
