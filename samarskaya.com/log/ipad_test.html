That dinner is FIRST DATE.</p>
<p>Because, what&rsquo;s a first date if not a chance to truly, scrupulously assess the person you&rsquo;re sitting across from? And, isn&rsquo;t the better opportunity to do that a situation where neither of you is exactly sure how to act, where the protocol hasn&rsquo;t been laid out as a passive groove? With that in mind, comes a dinner inspired by all of the delicious platters I&rsquo;ve been presented and confounded by. The udon noodle that wraps itself entirely throughout the oversized bowl and never stops. The whole crab goading me with it&rsquo;s shell and flashbacks of eighties movies with it flying across the room. The four-tier sandwiches that are at least twice as big as my mouth. The unwieldy lettuce leafs that landed from the likes of James and the Giant Peach. All absolutely delicious, and all an adventure in eating.</p>
<p>Planned as an intimate dinner for fourteen. Dates TBD.</p><p class="meta">[<a class="permalink" rel="106" href="/firstdate">Permalink</a> | <a class="admin" href="/login/object/edit/?id=106&amp;object_id=4">edit</a>]</p><p class="date post_105"><time datetime="2011-10-06T00:00:00">October 2011</time></p><p>Always planning away for a potential, unprecedented apocalyptic decline, at fourteen I negotiated a series of contracts with my friends for their souls.

<p>Update: Having just returned, I now want to do my undergrad all over again. I was completely seduced by the the beautiful facilities, vista and architecture of the Bennington campus.

Simultaneously, I&rsquo;d love to be teaching more again and am looking forward to future opportunities.

<p>The first objective in designing these cards was to illustrate the company name, Eighties Bangs, in a style that was true to form, reminiscent and memorable.

After sifting through type of the era, a custom fatface was designed that would resonate with the decade without aligning the firm to any one specific product of the past.

<p>For this year&rsquo;s March, the gift of a round-trip flight needed to be able to be presented subtly and slyly without too much build-up or fanfare. Thus, a gift card that could fit into a standard envelope was created. Printed as a lenticular print and typeset in Gateway A2, the card shifts between New York (JFK) and Reykjavik (KEF), referencing terminal departure/arrival boards, with an extra hint of an area map underneath.</p><p class="meta">[<a class="images empty" name="78">Addn'l Images</a> | <a class="permalink" rel="78" href="/airgiftcard">Permalink</a> | <a class="admin" href="/login/object/edit/?id=78&amp;object_id=4">edit</a>]</p><p class="date post_23"><time datetime="2010-02-01T00:00:00">February 2010</time></p><p>Today was my first day taking Advanced Russian Grammar &amp; Composition at NYU, with thanks to Prof. Belodedova.

<p>BLUE HAMMER is a performance project that unfolds in a late-night cable television studio, between two live broadcasts: a cooking show, HOT POT, and BLUE HAMMER, presented by a host named Vin Pays who professes to have toured Africa during the Mau-Mau uprising in Kenya and the Belgian occupation of the Congo. A guest joins him, the former leading-lady of the African tour [and of Hammer Horror films] named Tabula Rasa, who appears only to disrupt and dispel, an angel of death whose memories of Africa are harder to maintain than Vin's nostalgia. The performance features three live video feeds, including GP S analysis, a prototype portable kitchen, and custom porcelain bowls.</p>

Super pleased to be selected amidst all of the other beauties on there, and thought I&rsquo;d use this as an opportunity to talk a bit more about what I was thinking in its design.</p>
<p>The first wall that I kept running into amidst all my sketches was that I was making a site for work that was inherently impossible to truly showcase in two dimensions and seventy two dpi. With most of the features being installations, there was so much that went into it that was important: the projected video that was meant to get interrupted by shadows as part of &ldquo;8&rdquo;, the controlled humidity in the bathroom and the soundtracks propped behind locked doors as you walked down the hallway to get there as part of &ldquo;...waking from the house&rdquo;, the prepared curry and performances that were all a visceral part of &ldquo;the gift&rdquo;. All of the lowered ceilings, cold air vent depositories to nowhere, camouflaged entrances and interactive aspects, I didn&rsquo;t know how to begin trying to shoehorn all of that into a browser.</p>
<p>With so many aspects of the original work being concealed, I thought I&rsquo;d take it a step further and make the browser&rsquo;s limitations a part of the design. The menu bar was going to be the centerpiece (easy to find and use!), placed atop of the content. It was aiming to expose the fact that you were viewing a barred experience, and hint that there was more there than meets the eye.</p>
<p>The site was then coded by hand, and skinned with my favorite overused office patterns of the 1990s. In the same way that the installations themselves were often a throwback and a contemplation of recent history, so the site would attempt to ruminate on the recent history within web and digital design.</p><p class="meta">[<a class="images empty" name="33">Addn'l Images</a> | <a href="http://2004.samarskaya.com">2004.samarskaya.com</a> | <a class="permalink" rel="33" href="/2004">Permalink</a> | <a class="admin" href="/login/object/edit/?id=33&amp;object_id=4">edit</a>]</p><p class="date post_50"><time datetime="2005-10-01T00:00:00">October 2005</time></p><p>After a couple of varied fits and starts (architecture agencies, nightclub interiors &amp; retail exhibition design) I&rsquo;ll be signing on to join Earth Pledge at their beautifully, sustainably remodeled headquarters in Murray Hill.

It was mostly government paperwork, Social Security statements, and other highly confidential yet equally impersonal data collection. Observing all these inhuman remnants, I wondered what it would be like if instead of documenting financial credits and debits, an organization jotted down people&rsquo;s idiosyncrasies. Those glimmers of personality and memory, all that which makes us unique, an identity divergent from the simple fact that one has $82.19 left over in a checking account. Thus, later, as a part of the William Ryan installations, a fictional government entity entitled the Ministry of Observations was created. A entity which tracks all of those lost moments, habits, decisions and preferences that makes all of us uniquely us.</p><p class="meta">[<a class="permalink" rel="42" href="/ministryofobservations">Permalink</a> | <a class="admin" href="/login/object/edit/?id=42&amp;object_id=4">edit</a>]</p><p class="date post_93"><time datetime="2002-11-01T00:00:00">November 2002</time></p><p>For a group photography exhibition entitled &ldquo;Photography, Collections&rdquo;. The branding was designed in reference to library collections, with library catalog card postcards.

While log.samarskaya.com is a written record on my work with an emphasis on branding, lettering and identity (with a smattering of design and print art here and there), the work that I was involved with directly prior was narrative installation art. Some of these early posts touch on the branding or print segments of an installation without going deeper into the work that was exhibited. If you&rsquo;re curious in those works, an archive of an older site that covers them from a macro viewpoint still exists at 2004.samarskaya.com.</p><p class="meta">[<a href="http://2004.samarskaya.com">2004.samarskaya.com</a> | <a class="permalink" rel="99" href="/2004_1998">Permalink</a> | <a class="admin" href="/login/object/edit/?id=99&amp;object_id=4">edit</a>]</p></div>
